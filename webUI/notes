/etc/crontab contains command to run /home/etc/cron.d/cron.pl every minute. It polls all the outlets for power usage and writes to month-by-month files in /home/laura/senior/code/SmartWallv1/webUI/historic
*NOTE: modify cron.pl when more outlets are available. It currently performs queries on outlet 0x0000000000000011 only and pretends it's doing each outlet
